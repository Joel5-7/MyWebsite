    <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
    <div class="dash"></div>
    <p>In this assignment, I have been tasked with learning the basics of web development to create a responsive website for an online portfolio about myself. The website consists of using HTML (Hyper Text Mark-up Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) for each page created. Furthermore, I have been using GitHub to keep a log of all the different changes and improvements I have made during the process of building the website. Within this report, I will be explaining my experience of developing a website and the design decisions that I made. </p>

    <h3 id="develop">Development Journey</h3>
    <div class="dash"></div>
    <p>Throughout the experience of learning web development, I have overcome many challenges and feel that I have a greater understanding of designing websites. My main positive outcome from creating the website is that I have a much better understanding of how to use a grid layout. This is because the CSS grid layout helped make the website responsive and consistently across each webpage. CSS gird also helped when placing images next to each other<a href="#111">(shown in Figures 1.1.1 – 1.1.2)</a>. CSS grid also helped when creating the portfolio page as I learned how to make a layout where the placeholders were in different positions (Powell, 2017).
        
    Another positive is learning how many different CSS concepts that can be used to create random elements on the webpage. For example, I have used ‘:hover’, ‘animation’, and ‘transition’ for random things on my website. This can be seen on the home page where I animated the text to transition in from the left. This was learnt by watching a tutorial on a typing animation (Rajahyaksha, 2017).

    I also faced negatives when creating the website where I felt this was trying to create a certain part for the website and all I was missing was one line of code. Other challenges I found along the way were trying to create the navigation bar and hamburger menu and setting the correct sizes for different elements on the webpages.     

    Throughout the website, I decided to have a consistent theme of a dark grey, bright orange and a white colour for the website. The reason for having these colours was because it matches the outfit, I am wearing on the index background picture. Furthermore, the font I decided to use for the website is called ‘Franklin Gothic Medium, Arial Narrow, Arial, sans-serif’, I choose this font because it stands out and is easy to read for the viewer. </p>
